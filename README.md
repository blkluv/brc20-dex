  <li>For swapping you have to be on mainnet. On other chains this does not work.</li>
  <li>You have to have some eth for gas fees to make swap.</li>
  <li>First you have to approve 1Inch agregator to make this swap and use your tokens. When transaction is completed wait cca 5-10 minutes to approve. Its little bit delayed. Then you can click again on swap button and make swap ! You can look to console. When there is make a swap, it means you are approved and you can make swap. Beware of sending multiple transactions, you have to wait like i said.</li>
